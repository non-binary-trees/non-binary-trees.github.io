## Projects

A project is any design project you want to work on. It consists of one or more [repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#repository) and probably one or more [teams](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#teams). You repositories hold all files and documentation. Your teams keep track of discussion about the project.
