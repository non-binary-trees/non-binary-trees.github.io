## Repositories

A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private. - [GitHub Glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#repository)
